            In order to reach your best life, you need to focus.
        </p>
        <p>
            In order to focus, you need to block all distractions.
        </p>
            If you're anything like me, right now you have several windows
            with 20+ tabs open each.
        <p>
            That's what tabBlock is made for.
        </p>
            Just input the number of tabs you'd want to limit to
            and the amount of time you'd like it to be in effect.
            tabBlock will block any new tabs from being created
            if you exceed the set limit during the period specified.
        <p>
            Research says that, at best, our working memory capacity
            (the amount of things we can pay attention to at a given time),
            is anywhere between 3-4 and up to 7 objects.
            So tabBlock has a max of 7 open tabs allowed,
            but your brain would prefer 3-4 max. Also, try focusing for longer than 5 minutes!
        </p>
        <p>
            Good luck!
